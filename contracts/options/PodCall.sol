 * @title PodCall
 * @author Pods Finance
 *
 * @notice Represents a tokenized Call option series for some long/short token pair.
 *
 * @dev Call options represents the right, not the obligation to buy the underlying asset
 * for strike price units of the strike asset.
 *
 * There are four main actions that can be done with an option:
 *
 *
 * Sellers can mint fungible call option tokens by locking 1:1 units
 * of underlying asset until expiration. Buyers can exercise their call, meaning
 * buying the locked underlying asset for strike price units of strike asset.
 * At the end, seller can retrieve back its collateral, that could be the underlying asset
 * AND/OR strike based on the contract's current ratio of underlying and strike assets.
 *
 * There are many option's style, but the most usual are: American and European.
 * The difference between them are the moments that the buyer is allowed to exercise and
 * the moment that seller can retrieve its locked collateral.
 *
 *  Exercise:
 *  American -> any moment until expiration
 *  European -> only after expiration and until the end of the exercise window
 *
 *  Withdraw:
 *  American -> after expiration
 *  European -> after end of exercise window
 *
 * Let's take an example: there is such an European call option series where buyers
 * may buy 1 WETH for 300 USDC until Dec 31, 2021.
 *
 * In this case:
 *
 * - Expiration date: Dec 31, 2021
 * - Underlying asset: WETH
 * - Strike asset: USDC
 * - Strike price: 300 USDC
 *
 * ETH holders may call mint() until the expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will lock their WETH into this contract
 * - Will issue option tokens corresponding to this WETH amount
 * - This contract is agnostic about where options could be bought or sold and how much the
 * the option premium should be.
 *
 * WETH holders who also hold the option tokens may call unmint() until the
 * expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will unlock their WETH from this contract
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of options tokens
 *
 * Option token holders may call exercise() after the expiration date and
 * end of before exercise window, to exercise their option, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will buy 1 ETH for 300 USDC (the strike price) each.
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of option tokens.
 *
 * WETH holders that minted options initially can call withdraw() after the
 * end of exercise window, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will give back its amount of collateral locked. That could be o mix of
 * underlying asset and strike asset based if and how the pool was exercised.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Note that after expiration, option tokens are worthless since they can not
 * be exercised and it price should worth 0 in a healthy market.
