/**
 * Represents a tokenized american put option series for ETH.
 * Internally it Wraps ETH to treat it seamlessly.
 *
 * It is fungible and it is meant to be freely tradable until its
 * expiration time, when its transfer functions will be blocked
 * and the only available operation will be for the option writers
 * to unlock their collateral.
 *
 * Let's take an example: there is such a put option series where buyers
 * may sell 1 ETH for 300 USDC until Dec 31, 2019.
 *
 * In this case:
 *
 * - Expiration date: Dec 31, 2019
 * - Underlying asset: DAI
 * - Strike asset: USDC
 * - Strike price: 300 USDC
 *
 * USDC holders may call mint() until the expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will lock their USDC into this contract
 * - Will issue put tokens corresponding to this USDC amount
 * - These put tokens will be freely tradable until the expiration date
 *
 * USDC holders who also hold the option tokens may call burn() until the
 * expiration date, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will unlock their USDC from this contract
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of put tokens
 *
 * Put token holders may call exerciseEth() until the expiration date, to
 * exercise their option, which in turn:
 *
 * - Will sell 1 ETH for 300 USDC (the strike price) each.
 * - Will burn the corresponding amount of put tokens.
